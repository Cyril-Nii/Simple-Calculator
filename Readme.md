# Multi-Language Calculator Project

## Overview

This repository contains simple calculator programs implemented in various programming languages. The goal of this project is to demonstrate and strengthen my understanding of basic programming concepts across multiple languages.

## Features

Each calculator supports the following operations:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division (with validation to prevent division by zero)

## Languages Used

- **Python**: A versatile and beginner-friendly language.
- **Java**: Known for its robust object-oriented capabilities.
- **JavaScript**: Essential for web development and dynamic interactions.
- **C++**: A high-performance language with a focus on efficiency.
- **C**: A foundational language for systems programming.
- **PHP**: A server-side scripting language for web development.
- Additional languages may be added as I learn more.

## Future Plans

- Add more languages
- Improve user interface and experience.
- Incorporate advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, power).

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository, add your implementations in new languages, and submit a pull request. Let's learn together!
